# Year Plan - 2020
In this world where everything is automated or in the proess of automation, as I am from a non - STEM background, in this new year I have decided to explore and gain knowledge in STEM field.

I believe that this is the essence of todays world - i.e., to have logical thinkinking, a computatonal thinking and a sight on how to automate things, simplify processes so that a larger population can derive benefit out of it.

Therefore I started my research on how to be a part of STEM and found the following courses online to evolve myself and gain knowledge :

  * [Computational Thinking for Problem Solving](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-thinking-problem-solving/) - University of Pennsylvania
  * [Introduction to Logic](https://www.coursera.org/learn/logic-introduction?=) - Stanford University
  * [Grow with Google - Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course/)
  * [Python for everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python?=) - Michigan University
  * [AI for everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone?) - deeplearning.ai

Further to these courses I am also planning to apply for Masters of Computer and Information Technology offered by university of Pennsylvania. It is an online course available on Coursera [MCIT]( https://www.coursera.org/degrees/mcit-penn)

If anyone has any better ideas, they are most welcome. Also let me know your thoughts on the above.
