In this world where everything is automated or in the proess of automation, As I am from a non - STEM background, in this new year I have decided to explore and gain knowledge in STEM field
I believe that this is the essence of todays world - i.e., to have logical thinkinking, a computatonal thinking and a sight on how to automate things, simplify processes so that a larger population can derive benefit out of it.
Therefore I started my research on how to be a part of STEM and found the following courses online to evolve myself and gain knowledge :
starting with 
Computational Thinking for Problem Solving - University of Pennsylvania (source - Coursera)
Introduction to Logic - Stanford University (source - Coursera)
Grow with Google - Crash course on python (source - Coursera)
Introduction to python - Michigan University (source - Coursera)
AI for everybody - deeplearning.ai (source - Coursera)

Further to these courses I am also planning to apply for Masters of Computer and Information Technology offered by university of Pennsylvania. It is an online course available on Coursera ( https://www.coursera.org/search?query=MCIT&page=1&configure%5BclickAnalytics%5D=true&indices%5Bprod_all_products_term_optimization%5D%5Bconfigure%5D%5BclickAnalytics%5D=true&indices%5Bprod_all_products_term_optimization%5D%5Bconfigure%5D%5BruleContexts%5D%5B0%5D=en&indices%5Bprod_all_products_term_optimization%5D%5Bconfigure%5D%5BhitsPerPage%5D=10 )

If anyone has any better ideas, they are most welcome. Also let me know your thoughts on the above
